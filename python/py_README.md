# MelodySyncer - The Fastest Spotify to Youtube API Ever.

MelodySyncer is a **Web API** to convert Spotify songs or playlists to their Youtube equivalent. It is also the **most accurate** since it uses a unique scoring system that minimizes searching credits and maximises accuracy by factoring in song metadata. Takes less than **100 milliseconds** per song! Built using Async Python + FastAPI, hosted on Vercel.

#### You get: _Skip manual searching, Directly get a List, Peace of Mind_ <br> I get _(hopefully): Star, Heart, Follow :)_
